# Debugging No Server Response Issue

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Check DigitalOcean App Logs
```bash
# In your DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard:
# Go to your app > Runtime Logs
# Look for any error messages during startup
```

### 2. Test with Simple Dockerfile
The current Dockerfile now uses `serve` instead of nginx, which should be more reliable.

### 3. Check Health Endpoint
Once deployed, try accessing:
- `https://your-app-url.ondigitalocean.app/health`

### 4. Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Port binding problems**
- Solution: The new Dockerfile uses `serve` which is more straightforward

**Issue: Build files not found**
- Solution: Single-stage build ensures everything is in the same container

**Issue: nginx configuration errors**
- Solution: Using `serve` removes nginx complexity

### 5. Alternative: Static Site Deployment

If Docker continues to have issues, you can deploy as a static site:

1. Build locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `build/` folder directly to:
   - DigitalOcean App Platform (Static Site)
   - Netlify
   - Vercel

### 6. Local Testing

Test the Docker image locally:
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t utrecht-test .

# Run it locally
docker run -p 3000:80 utrecht-test

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### 7. DigitalOcean App Platform Settings

Make sure your app settings have:
- Source: GitHub repository
- Build command: (leave empty, Docker handles it)
- HTTP port: 80
- Health check: /health

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Redeploy on DigitalOcean
3. Check the runtime logs for any errors
4. If still failing, try static site deployment instead
